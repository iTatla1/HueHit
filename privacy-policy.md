## Summary

* No accounts or logins. We don‚Äôt ask for your name or contact details.
* The app shows ads via **Google AdMob** and uses **Apple‚Äôs SKAdNetwork** for privacy-preserving attribution.
* We run **ATT OFF** on iOS: we **do not** use the IDFA and **do not** track you across other apps/websites.
* Where required (e.g., EEA/UK), we use Google‚Äôs **User Messaging Platform (UMP)** to collect ad consent.
* A **Privacy & Consent** button (üõ°Ô∏è) is available on the **main menu** so you can review/change your choices anytime if in EEA/UK and other supported regions.

## What data is processed and why

### Advertising (AdMob)

When ads are displayed, Google and its advertising partners may receive:

* **Approximate location** (inferred from IP address)
* **Device & app info** (device model, OS/app version, language, screen size)
* **Usage & advertising data** (ad impressions, clicks, session events)
* **Identifiers not used for cross-app tracking** (e.g., **IDFV**, Firebase Install/Instance ID)

**Purposes:** deliver and cap ads, measure performance, and prevent fraud/abuse.

> Because ATT is off, the **IDFA** is not used. Install attribution relies on **SKAdNetwork** (aggregated, non-user-level postbacks).

### Firebase (only for modules we enable)

* **Analytics** Anonymous event data about feature usage (e.g., sessions, screens).
  We do not use Firebase to identify you personally.

### We do **not** collect

Your name, email, phone number, contacts, photos, precise GPS location, microphone/camera content, or your browsing history.

## Your choices & controls

### In-app control (shield button on menu)

Open **HueHit** ‚Üí tap **üõ°Ô∏è Privacy & Consent** on the **main menu** to:

* Review or change your ad consent choices (EEA/UK and other supported regions),
* Switch between personalized (where available) and **non-personalized/contextual** ads,
* View partners and purposes presented by the consent form.

### Device settings

You can adjust Apple advertising settings and reset identifiers in **Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security**. (Note: IDFA isn‚Äôt used here because ATT is off.)

---

## Legal bases (EEA/UK)

* **Consent:** For ad purposes requiring consent, we present a consent dialog via **UMP**. If you decline, we serve **non-personalized** ads.
* **Legitimate interests/necessity:** Minimal processing needed to operate the app, measure performance in aggregate, and prevent fraud.

---

## Sharing of data

We share data with:

* **Google** (AdMob/Firebase) and its advertising demand partners to deliver and measure ads,
* Service providers that process data on our behalf under appropriate safeguards.

We **do not sell** your personal information.

---

## Retention

We don‚Äôt maintain user accounts or our own user profiles. Data handled by Google/AdMob/Firebase is retained according to their policies and only as long as needed for the stated purposes.

---

## International transfers

Google may process data on servers outside your country. Where required, Google applies safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses.

---

## Children‚Äôs privacy

HueHit is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided data, contact us and we‚Äôll delete it.

---

## Your rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, delete, or restrict processing of your data. Because we don‚Äôt maintain user accounts, requests generally concern data held by Google. See the links below.
